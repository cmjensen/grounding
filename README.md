# grounding

Grounding is a web-app based psychotherapeutic tool for managing overwhelming feelings or anxiety. An empirically-supported practice, "grounding" brings the mind to the present sensorial experience in order to interrupt intrusive, cyclical thoughts. This web app guides users through the grounding experience.
